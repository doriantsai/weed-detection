""" script to test image size """

# setup model for rescale sizes of:
scales = [256, 512, 1024, 2056]

# train model with rescale size set for each scale index
# do model comparison on each model with the same datasets (including both positive and negative images)

# get PR curve for all

# also, get a model inference times, (JUST model inference)
# plot on a graph vs time to compute for a single image
